## increasingSnakeEyes
"Rolls" two dice until both come up as 1 and then increases "amount of sides" of the dice.
Takes number of sides as parameter, default to 10.
'''bash
$ python increasingSnakeEyes.py 100
'''

Prints in a format that allows for plotting with [katef's plot.awk](https://gist.github.com/katef/fb4cb6d47decd8052bd0e8d88c03a102)
[![Two plots of increasingSnakeEyes.py. The first one using dice up to 10 and the second up to 100. The plots have dots for the index and number of rolls needed to get snake eyes. There are large fluctuations from index to index for how many rolls were needed. Almost as if it was random. Because it should be indistinguishable from truly random.](/images/plot.png)]
